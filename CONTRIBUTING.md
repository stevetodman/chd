# Contributing to CHD

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We want to make the process as smooth as possible, so please review the guidelines below before opening an issue or pull request.

## Getting Started
- Familiarize yourself with the project by reading the [`README.md`](README.md) and browsing the existing code.
- Search the issue tracker to avoid duplicating work. If you do not find an existing issue, open a new one describing the change you would like to make.
- For significant changes, please discuss your proposal with the maintainers before starting work.

## Development Workflow
1. Create a new branch for your contribution.
2. Make your changes with clear, incremental commits and descriptive messages.
3. Update documentation, tests, and examples to reflect your changes.
4. Run the relevant tests and linters locally before submitting your pull request. Please include the commands you ran in the PR description.

## Pull Requests
- Keep pull requests focused on a single topic. Large or unrelated changes should be split into multiple PRs.
- Ensure that CI passes before requesting a review.
- Fill out every section of the pull request template, including notes on linting, tests, and any UI screenshots when applicable.
- Be responsive to reviewer feedback. Discussions are a normal part of the processâ€”please be respectful and collaborative.

## Coding Standards
- Follow any existing style conventions in the surrounding code.
- Add or update tests when fixing bugs or adding features.
- Include docstrings and comments where they improve clarity.

## Community Expectations
- Be kind and inclusive. We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels.
- When in doubt, ask questions! Opening a draft pull request early can help surface potential issues quickly.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you.
