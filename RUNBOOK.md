# CHD QBank Runbook

Operational steps for seeding environments, releasing to production, and rolling back are now centralized in [`docs/ops/release-runbook.md`](./docs/ops/release-runbook.md).

That guide includes:

- Environment maps and Supabase configuration checklists.
- Seeding, verification, and invite-code rotation workflows.
- CI gates, manual rehearsal steps, and rollback guidance.
- Day-one monitoring expectations.

Update any saved links to reference the consolidated runbook.
