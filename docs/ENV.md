# Environment Variable Reference

All environment variable guidance now lives in the consolidated runtime guide: [`docs/runtime/environment-configuration.md`](./runtime/environment-configuration.md).

That document covers the frontend `VITE_*` settings, service-role secrets for automation, and shell workflows for seeding invite codes. Update any bookmarks pointing here.
