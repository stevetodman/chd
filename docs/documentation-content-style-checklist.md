# Content Style Checklist

Use this checklist when authoring or reviewing clinical or educational content to keep voice, accuracy, and sourcing consistent across the project.

## Audience and Tone
- [ ] Write for practicing clinicians and advanced trainees. Define acronyms on first use unless they are universally recognized in the specialty.
- [ ] Favor concise, declarative sentences. Avoid marketing language or unfounded superlatives.
- [ ] Use active voice when describing actions readers should take (e.g., "Obtain baseline labs" rather than "Baseline labs should be obtained").

## Clinical Accuracy
- [ ] Reference current guidelines or primary literature for any diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic claim.
- [ ] Note the strength or quality of evidence when relevant (e.g., guideline class/level, trial design, sample size).
- [ ] Include key contraindications, monitoring requirements, and escalation criteria when recommending interventions.

## Source Management
- [ ] Provide inline citations for every clinical claim or statistic. Use the format `(Author Year)` or `(Guideline Organization, Year)` and include a references section when more than three sources are cited.
- [ ] Prefer peer-reviewed sources published within the last five years unless citing foundational trials or consensus statements that remain current.
- [ ] Verify links are accessible without paywalls when possible; include DOI in addition to URLs for journal articles.

## Inclusive Language
- [ ] Use people-first language and avoid assumptions about gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or socioeconomic status.
- [ ] Specify patient populations studied in cited evidence (e.g., "evidence from adult patients" or "data derived from pediatric cohorts").
- [ ] Highlight known health equity considerations, including differential outcomes or access barriers.

## Formatting Consistency
- [ ] Use Markdown headings in sentence case (e.g., `## Treatment approach`).
- [ ] Present ordered sequences as numbered lists and decision branches as bullet lists.
- [ ] Embed tables only when data density requires it; otherwise prefer lists for readability on mobile devices.

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run spelling and grammar checks before submission.
- [ ] Confirm that any calculations, conversions, or dosage adjustments have been double-checked by a second reviewer when feasible.
- [ ] Document any outstanding questions or assumptions in the PR description to assist reviewers.
