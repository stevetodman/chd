# High-Impact Website Improvements

As a professional website designer reviewing the current CHD QBank interface, here are the three most impactful updates to elevate usability, visual polish, and conversion.

## 1. Craft a Purpose-Built Dashboard Hero
- **Current state:** The dashboard immediately lists cards and metrics without a clear visual hierarchy, so users are left to parse data before understanding the most important next action.
- **Recommendation:** Introduce a hero strip at the top of the dashboard featuring a welcome headline, the learner's alias, and a primary CTA ("Resume practice" or "Start new quiz"). Use a soft gradient or illustrated background paired with a concise progress summary chip.
- **Impact:** Establishing an above-the-fold focal point clarifies the page's intent, improves scannability, and drives higher engagement with the main action within the first 5 seconds on page.

## 2. Elevate Data Visualization & Feedback
- **Current state:** The PracticeTrendChart component renders data but lacks contextual annotations, onboarding copy, or empty states that explain why the chart matters.
- **Recommendation:** Add a lightweight tooltip system with weekly delta comparisons, annotate the peak and most recent week, and include celebratory microcopy for streaks. When data is missing, show a friendly illustration explaining how to build history.
- **Impact:** Richer context transforms raw metrics into actionable insight, helping learners feel progress momentum and increasing repeat practice sessions.

## 3. Build a Consistent Visual Language for Cards
- **Current state:** Cards across Dashboard, Practice, and Review views mix shadows, border radii, and typography scales, creating a slightly fragmented visual rhythm.
- **Recommendation:** Define a shared card system in `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` with standardized padding, elevation levels, and headline/body text tokens. Apply subtle hover states and status accents (e.g., success for mastered topics).
- **Impact:** Harmonizing card styles reduces cognitive load, strengthens brand perception, and lays groundwork for theming or marketing site parity.

## 4. Build a Cohesive Visual System and Component Library
- **Current state:** The Tailwind theme only exposes a single custom brand palette and one width token, so teams reinvent tonal values, typography scales, and elevations locally instead of pulling from shared primitives. High-traffic screens assemble controls with long Tailwind class strings (e.g., select menus, filter pills, multi-column cards), which leads to subtle spacing, focus, and breakpoint inconsistencies from page to page.
- **Recommendation:** Expand the design token set beyond a single brand palette by adding full color ramps, spacing steps, typography scales, and shadow elevations in the Tailwind config. Extract recurring interaction patterns—filter chips, form fields, secondary cards—into documented React components that consume the shared tokens. Provide usage guidelines and Storybook examples so product teams can reach polished, on-brand surfaces quickly while making dark mode and future re-theming straightforward.
- **Impact:** A richer token system plus reusable components creates a unified aesthetic, reduces implementation drift, and accelerates feature work by giving engineers and designers a single source of truth for visuals.
